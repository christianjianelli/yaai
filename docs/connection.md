# yaai - ABAP AI tools - Connection object

The `Connection` object manages communication between ABAP and external Large Language Model (LLM) APIs such as OpenAI and Ollama. It handles HTTP client creation, API Key retrieval, endpoint construction, and response handling.

### Configuration

**The configuration is optional**. Its main purpose is to simplify and streamline the use of supported APIs by allowing the `ABAP AI tools` to automatically resolve endpoints. Without configuration, you will need to provide connection details manually when instantiating the `Connection` object.

The Connection object retrieves base URLs for supported APIs from the SAP table `TVARVC`. 

For example, you can maintain the following parameters (see also [Configuration Parameters](config.md)):

| Parameter Name           | Description                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| YAAI_OPENAI_BASE_URL    | Base URL for OpenAI API endpoints           |
| YAAI_OLLAMA_BASE_URL    | Base URL for Ollama API endpoints           |
| YAAI_GOOGLE_BASE_URL    | Base URL for Google Gemini API endpoints    |

Example entries in TVARVC:

| NAME                   | VALUE                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| YAAI_OPENAI_BASE_URL   | https://api.openai.com/                      |
| YAAI_OLLAMA_BASE_URL   | http://localhost:11434                       |
| YAAI_GOOGLE_BASE_URL   | https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com    |

### Automatic Instantiation

If the configuration parameters are properly maintained, the ABAP AI framework will automatically create and manage the `Connection` instance for you. In most cases, you do not need to instantiate the object manuallyâ€”simply use the relevant ABAP AI APIs, and the connection will be handled internally.

### Manual Instantiation

You can instantiate the Connection object by specifying the API name:

```abap
DATA(lo_conn) = NEW ycl_aai_conn( i_api = 'OPENAI' ).
```

This will automatically:
- Set the base URL from TVARVC (e.g., `YAAI_OPENAI_BASE_URL`)
- Retrieve the API key using the API name
- Prepare the HTTP client for requests

You can also set or override the base URL and API key manually:

```abap
lo_conn->set_base_url( 'https://custom.api/' ).
```

### API Keys

API keys are managed via the `ycl_aai_api_keys` class and are set automatically during instantiation if available. You can also set them explicitly using the method `set_api_key` of the ycl_aai_conn class.

```abap
lo_conn->set_api_key( 'your-api-key' ).
```

### SSL Setup

To enable secure HTTPS connections to external APIs, you must import the relevant SSL certificates into your SAP system. This ensures that your ABAP system can establish trusted connections with services such as OpenAI or Google.

**Steps for SSL setup:**
1. Obtain the root and intermediate certificates from the API provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google).
2. Import these certificates into the SAP system using transaction **STRUST**.
3. Assign the certificates to the appropriate SSL client PSE (e.g., `ANONYM` or `DEFAULT`).

For detailed, step-by-step instructions, refer to the abapGit documentation:
- [abapGit SSL Setup Guide](https://docs.abapgit.org/user-guide/setup/ssl-setup.html)

**Troubleshooting SSL errors:**
- If you encounter SSL handshake or certificate errors when connecting to APIs, consult SAP Note **510007** for additional guidance:
  - [SAP Note 510007 - Additional considerations about setting up SSL on Application Server ABAP](https://me.sap.com/notes/510007)

**Tip:**  
If you are using the SAP NetWeaver ABAP Developer Edition and face persistent SSL issues, consider using a reverse proxy to simplify connectivity. See [Reverse Proxy Setup](reverse_proxy.md) for more information.

### Notes

- The `Connection` object automatically sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. By default, the SAP class **cl_http_client** appends `;charset=utf-8` to this header. The Nvidia API require the `Content-Type` to be exactly `application/json` and will return an error if any charset is present. The `suppress_content_type` method can be used to suppress the entire `Content-Type` header.
