# yaai - ABAP AI tools
This repository provides a set of tools designed to facilitate Artificial Intelligence capabilities within ABAP environments.

## Key Features
- **OpenAI and Ollama Support**: Seamlessly connect your ABAP applications to both OpenAI (cloud-based) and Ollama (local/self-hosted) LLM APIs, enabling flexible deployment options.
- **Conversation Management**: Maintain and manage multi-turn conversations, with full access to conversation history for advanced chat scenarios.
- **Tool/Function Calling**: Integrate ABAP business logic with LLMs using function/tool calling, allowing AI models to trigger ABAP methods.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhance LLM outputs by incorporating enterprise data, enabling more accurate and relevant answers through retrieval-augmented generation workflows.

These features empower you to build intelligent, enterprise-ready ABAP applications that leverage the latest advancements in AI.

This repository focuses on backend AI integration for ABAP. For a ready-to-use user interface—including chat and code assistance apps—check out our companion project:
